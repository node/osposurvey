The 2022 Open Source Program Office (OSPO) Survey was fielded by the TODO Group, Linux Foundation Research, and partners between June 21 through August 1, 2022. The goal was to gauge prevalence and outcomes of open source programs and similar open source initiatives operating across the globe.

The first section of the survey was completed by 1,048 respondents affiliated with an organization that is involved with open source to some extent. After minimizing the number of duplicate organizations, the sample size for much of the study drops to 950, with 628 respondents completing every question.
